# Search
BFS and A* Search with one and many waypoints that I completed for my Artificial Intelligence class

1. Breadth-first search, with one waypoint.
`python3 main.py data/part-1/open --search bfs`

2. A* search, with one waypoint.
`python3 main.py data/part-2/tiny --search astar_single`

3. A* search, with many waypoints.
`python3 main.py data/part-3/tiny --search astar_multiple`

4. Heuristic search, with many waypoints.
